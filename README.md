# Laptop Price Prediction

## Overview
My **semester project** for "Machine Learning" subject.
Price prediction (Regression) with Machine and Deep Learning based on hardware. The results could have been better if the dataset included hardware specifications such as VRAM, Cache size, Clock speed, etc.

## Dataset
The dataset can be accessed on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pradeepjangirml007/laptop-data-set)
I wouldn't recommend this dataset. It's from a webscraping project, I've spent several hours cleaning with Regex.
